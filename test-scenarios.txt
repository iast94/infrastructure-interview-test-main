#Functional Testing Scenarios:

-Verify that the application launches successfully after deployment.
-Test user authentication: Ensure users can log in and access their accounts.
-Check functionality of critical features (e.g., submitting forms, making API requests, etc.).
-Validate error handling: Test how the application handles unexpected errors or invalid inputs.


#Performance Testing Scenarios:

-Test application performance under different load conditions (low, moderate, high) to ensure scalability.
-Measure response times for various API endpoints under different loads.
-Check the application's resource utilization (CPU, memory) during peak loads.
-Assess the application's ability to handle concurrent users.
